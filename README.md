# Case For ROI-based Tuition
# Project Title: Differential Tuition Model for Reducing Student Debt

## Overview
This project explores the impact of rising student debt in America and proposes a differential tuition model based on degree and major to create a more equitable educational landscape. The goal is to align tuition fees with expected return on investment and potential earning power, reducing the financial burden on students in fields with traditionally lower starting salaries.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze the current state of student debt in America.
- Showcase the disparities in debt-to-income ratios across different majors.
- Argue the case for implementing a differential tuition pricing model.
- Provide a data-driven approach to support the argument for reforming tuition fees.

## Data Visualization
The project includes a series of data visualizations that illustrate:
- The rising trend of student loan debt over recent years.
- The contrast in debt-to-income ratios among various majors.
- Unemployment rates and their relation to student debt by major.
- The potential economic and societal benefits of a differential tuition model.

## Presentation
Included in this repository is a presentation that outlines the argument for differential tuition. The presentation slides are supported by persuasive data visualizations and a script that concisely conveys the urgency of the issue and the need for change.
